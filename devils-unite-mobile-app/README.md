# Welcome to DevilsUnite Mobile App ðŸ‘‹

This is the mobile application for DevilsUnite, built using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (for iOS development on macOS)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) (for running the app on physical devices)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DevilsUnite.git
   cd DevilsUnite/devils-unite-mobile-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the App**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   In the output, youâ€™ll find options to open the app in a Development Build, Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or Expo Goâ€”a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo.

### Running on Physical Devices

#### iOS
1. Install Xcode: Ensure you have Xcode installed from the Mac App Store.
2. Download Expo Go: Install the Expo Go app from the App Store.
3. Connect Device: Connect your iPhone to your computer.
4. Run the App: Use the QR code generated by `npx expo start` to open the app in Expo Go.

#### Android
1. Install Android Studio: Ensure you have Android Studio installed.
2. Download Expo Go: Install the Expo Go app from the Google Play Store.
3. Enable Developer Mode: Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your Android device.
4. Connect Device: Connect your Android device to your computer.
5. Run the App: Use the QR code generated by `npx expo start` to open the app in Expo Go.

### Project Structure

You can start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory. This project uses file-based routing.

### Resetting the Project

If you need a fresh start, run:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This command will move the starter code to the `app-example` directory and create a blank `app` directory where you can start developing.
